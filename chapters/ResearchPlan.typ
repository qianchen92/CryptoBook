- Lattice-based Signatures with Tight Adaptive Corruptions and More
  - Paper: @PKC:PanWag22
  - Contributions: They construct the first lattice-based signature scheme with tight security against adaptive corruption.
    The construction is based on the standard $LWE$ assumption. The key caveat is that in bothe the $RLWE$ and $MLWE$ settings,
    the scheme is not tightly secure against adaptive corruption.
